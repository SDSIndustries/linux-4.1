* Atmel Quad Serial Peripheral Interface (QSPI)

Required properties:
- compatible:     should be "atmel,sama5d2-qspi"
- reg:            the first contains the register location and length,
                  the second contains the memory mapping address and length
- interrupts:     should contain the interrupt for the device
- clocks:         the phandle of the clock needed by the QSPI controller
- #address-cells: should be <1>
- #size-cells:    should be <0>

Example:

spi@f0020000 {
	compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-qspi";
	reg = <0xf0020000 0x100>,
	      <0xd0000000 0x8000000>;
	interrupts = <52 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 7>;
	clocks = <&spi0_clk>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_spi0_default>;
	status = "okay";

	m25p80@0 {
		...
	};
};
